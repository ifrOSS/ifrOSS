## Categories
The ifrOSS License Center collects licenses for free content and assigns them to different license types. These are organized into the following categories:

* [Free Software und Open Source Licences](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/foss/en)
* [Open Content Licences](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/opencontent/en)
* [Open Data Licences](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/opencontent/en)
* [Open Hardware Licences](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/openhardware/en)
* [Other Free Licenses](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/other_licenses/en)
* [Similar Licences, that do not meet the requirements of the OSI Definition](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/nonfree/en)
* [Ethical Licenses](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/ethical/en)
* [Public Domain Statements](/ifrOSS/wip.html)
* [Open AI Licences](/ifrOSS/Pages/licence_center/openai/en)
 
This makes finding and characterizing new licenses easier. As new licenses are constantly being created, appear in new versions or are no longer accessible under their old URL, everyone's participation in updating this list is welcome.
